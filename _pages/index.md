# What is probabilistic programming?
{: style="text-align: center"}

Probabilistic programming is the intersection of software engineering and probabilistic modeling, inference, and learning. Probabilistic programming systems are tools that make it easier to implement probabilistic inference and learning algorithms; analogously to how deep learning frameworks make it easier to implement and train and deploy neural networks.

# Why Gen?
{: style="text-align: center"}

### Gen supports custom hybrid inference algorithms
Neural network inference is fast, but can be inaccurate on out-of-distribution data, and requires expensive training. Model-based inference is more computationally expensive, but does not require retraining, and can be more accurate. Gen supports custom hybrid inference algorithms that benefit from the strengths of both approaches.

### Gen users implement custom algorithms without extending the language implementation
Instead of an inference engine, Gen provides a flexible "Trace" data type for implementing an open-ended set of inference and learning algorithms without touching the modeling-language implementation. Gen trace operations includes automatic differentiation (AD), but goes beyond AD and includes other operations needed for model-based reasoning.

### Gen supports inference in open-universe models
Generative and inference models in Gen can have stochastic control flow (dimension). Support for custom reversible jump MCMC allows for much more efficient inference over model structure.

### Gen is extensible
Gen is designed for extensibility and to support incremental performance optimization as the inference application is scaled from a small-scale proof of concept to a prototype. Users can optimize bottlenecks in their model by hand-optimized code that inter-operates with Gens inference library code.

# Installing Gen
{: style="text-align: center"}
<br>
First, [download Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/).
The, install the Gen package with the Julia package manager:

From the Julia REPL, type `]` to enter the Pkg REPL mode and then run:
```
pkg> add Gen
```

# The Gen team
{: style="text-align: center"}
Gen was originally created by [Marco Cusumano-Towner](http://web.mit.edu/marcoct/www/) at the [MIT Probabilistic Computing Project](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/), which is led by [Vikash Mansinghka](http://probcomp.csail.mit.edu/principal-investigator/).
Gen continues to evolve with the help of a group of core contributors including ..., in concert with a community of open-source contributors.
