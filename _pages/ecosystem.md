# Gen Ecosystem

## Core packages

### [Gen](https://github.com/probcomp/Gen.jl)
The main Gen package.
Contains the abstract interfaces to models, general-purpose modeling languages, and a minimal inference library.

### [GenPyTorch](https://github.com/probcomp/GenPyTorch.jl)
Gen modeling language that wraps PyTorch computation graphs.

### [GenTF](https://github.com/probcomp/GenTF)
Gen modeling language that wraps TensorFlow computation graphs.

### [GenFluxOptimizers](https://github.com/probcomp/GenFluxOptimizers.jl)
Enables the use of any of [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl)'s optimizers for parameter learning in generative functions from Gen's static or dynamic modeling languages.

### [GenParticleFilters](https://github.com/probcomp/GenParticleFilters.jl)
Building blocks for basic and advanced particle filtering.

### [GenSMC](https://github.com/probcomp/GenSMC)
Building blocks for pseudo-marginal Monte Carlo algorithms and annealed importance sampling.

## Contributed packages

### [GenHMM](https://github.com/probcomp/GenHMM.jl)
Domain-specific modeling library for fast inference in hidden Markov models.
